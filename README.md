<h2>Getting Started</h2>
Go to www.Azure.com. In order to create a virtual machine, you will need an Azure account. Azure is a pay per use service, but don’t worry. There is a free trial available that gives you $200 worth of tokens. You can experiment and familiarize yourself with all of its features, and you will likely not come close to exhausting this limit.

<h3>Creating a Virtual Machine</h3>
Once you’ve created an account, you’ll see this portal. In order to create a VM, click on “Create a Resource” then on the next screen click on the “Create” option beneath “Virtual Machine”

Once on the “Create a Virtual Machine” screen, you will be provided with several options in order to create a VM that fits your required specifications. You may name it whatever you’d like, as well as choose between an abundance of Windows, and Linux operating systems. You can also change the VM’s region of origin.

The most important category on this screen is the username and password you choose for your administrator account. Make absolutely sure you remember what you’ve selected, or else you will not be able to use your VM

Confirm you have the rights, review, and then create.

After the VM is created, all that is left is to open it. Press the windows key and search for “Remote Desktop Connection” Select the IP for your VM and input it. Once prompted for your login information, enter the username and password you set earlier.

Congratulations, you have created a virtual machine that will be useful for all the other tutorials that can be found on this page!
